# Tools for efficient science
This repository holds a copy of a presentation meant to introduce new researchers to useful (open) tools for research.
See [tools.md](tools.md) for the presentation content, which is converted by pandoc into a [beamer presentation](tools.pdf) and a [handout](handout.pdf).
The beamer presentation uses the [metropolis theme](/matze/mtheme).

You need the Fira Sans fonts and XeTeX to compile these documents correctly.

Compile using `Make`
```
make tools.pdf
make handout.pdf
```
